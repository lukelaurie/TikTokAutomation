She stepped inside, finding herself in a magical forest where animals spoke and trees sang. A wise owl approached her and said, You have discovered the Enchanted Woods. Here, kindness is the only magic you need. With a smile, Lily knew she had found a place where her imagination could soar forever. As the book closed, she promised to return and share her newfound magic with her village."
